# MMS

[Git Source](https://github.com/Nox-Labs/sms-evm-contracts/blob/15a987dcda55f8dfabcf220505750bc01f9d6f51/src/MMS.sol)

**Inherits:**
[IMMS](/src/interface/IMMS.sol/interface.IMMS.md), [TWAB](/src/extensions/TWAB.sol/contract.TWAB.md), [SMSDataHubKeeper](/src/extensions/SMSDataHubKeeper.sol/abstract.SMSDataHubKeeper.md), UUPSUpgradeable

Has 6 decimals.

This is yield-bearing stablecoin pegged to SMS 1:1.
Yielding is done by converting SMS to MMS and claiming rewards in SMS.
Each round has a different reward rate and duration specified by admin,
if admin didn't specify this data then the next round starts with previous conditions.

During the rounds, staker's balance is tracked by TWAB
and rewards are calculated based on the average balance of the staker in the round.
After the round is finalized, the SMS rewards are transferred to the MMS contract from the admin.
Also stakers can claim rewards during the round, but this creates a debt on the MMS contract,
so it's impossible to redeem all MMS and claim all rewards while admin didn't finalize the current round.

All actions are allowed only for minter except for admin functionalities.

## State Variables

### BP_PRECISION

The precision of the basis points.

1% = 100bp.

BP stands for Basis Points.

```solidity
uint16 public constant BP_PRECISION = 1e4;
```

### INTERNAL_MATH_PRECISION

The precision of the internal math.

```solidity
uint128 constant INTERNAL_MATH_PRECISION = 1e30;
```

### totalDebt

The total debt of the MMS contract in SMS to all users (not including the current round)

If totalDebt is positive, it means surplus of SMS on MMS contract. (All users can redeem and claim `totalDebt` as rewards) (If all users redeem and claim rewards, the debt will be zero)

If totalDebt is negative, it means shortfall of SMS on MMS contract. (All users can't redeem and claim whole rewards)

```solidity
int256 public totalDebt;
```

### roundTimestamps

The timestamps of the rounds.

_The length of the array - 2 is the number of rounds._

_The first element is the start timestamp of the first round._

_The second element is the end timestamp of the first round and the start timestamp of the second round._

_[startTimestampOfRound0, startTimestampOfRound1, startTimestampOfRound2, ...]_

```solidity
uint32[] public roundTimestamps;
```

### \_roundInfo

The information of the rounds.

roundInfo is the information of the round.

```solidity
mapping(uint32 roundId => RoundInfo roundInfo) private _roundInfo;
```
